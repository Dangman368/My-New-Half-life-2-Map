# My-New-Half-life-2-Map
This is my new half-life 2 map i created
There is a hidden wall that you can walk
Through and have loads of fun the wall is located at the spawn of the level
This was downloaded from Github
If you want to run the map you need Half-life 2 then go to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-life 2\hl2\maps"
Then put "example.bsp" to the maps folder
Then run half-life 2  go to options then go to Keyboard go to advanced and enable Developer Console.
Then close that then press ` then enter in "map example" without quotations or something then press enter
Then your done.
